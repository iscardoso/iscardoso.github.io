      <h1>About myself</h1>
          <p>I'm a computer science student at the University of Texas at Dallas. 
          <br><br>During my free time I like to read, watch movies, and rewatch old shows like Friends, The IT Crowd, Boy Meets World, etc. 
          <br><br>I also like to travel even though I don't get to do it as often as I would like to. Some places I've visited: Mexico city, Memphis, TN, Chicago, and New York city. I hope to one day travel to Europe and visit France and Spain.

          Here are some pictures I took during my trip to NYC...</p>
